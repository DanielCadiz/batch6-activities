        <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>
        <dt>Dear Eileen,</dt><br>
        <dt>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part</dt>
        <dt>of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</dt>
        <h2>Starting dates</h2>
        <dt>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you</dt>
        <dt>could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</dt><br>
        <dd><li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li></dd>
        <dd><li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li></dd>
        <dd><li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li></dd><br>
        <dt>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</dt><br>
        <dt>You can find more information about <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk02wdv9pgsmZTC42TTuVYJHPh8Tiig%3A1611060449954&source=hp&ei=4dQGYNLTN8zmwQOP7IGgBA&q=important+university+dates&oq=important+university+dates&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIFCAAQyQMyAggAMgIILjICCAAyBggAEBYQHjIGCAAQFhAeMgYIABAWEB4yBggAEBYQHjIGCAAQFhAeMgYIABAWEB46CAgAELEDEMkDOgUIABCxAzoICAAQsQMQgwFQzwRYyDhghz1oAHAAeACAAZEFiAGqJ5IBCTItMi4yLjIuNZgBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXo&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwiSyNDug6juAhVMc3AKHQ92AEQQ4dUDCAc&uact=5">important university dates</a> on our website.</dt>
        <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
        <dt>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall</dt>
        <dt>somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just</dt>
        <dt>the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued</dt>
        <dt>by are as follows, in order of priority:</dt>
        <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
        <dt>At the Awsome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subjects fall</dt>
        <dt>somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just</dt>
        <dt>the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued</dt>
        <dt>by are as follows, in order of priority:</dt><br>
        <dd>1. Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H12O3.)</dd>
        <dd>2. Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the</dd>
        <dd>audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 103 increasing to 3 × 104.)</dd>
        <dd>3. HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</dd><br>
        <dt>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the</dt>
        <dt>research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</dt>
        <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
        <dt>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,</dt>
        <dt>my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</dt><br>
        <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
        <dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around</dd>
        <dd>to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</dd>
        <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
        <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which</dd>
        <dd>involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly</dd>
        <dd>tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired</dd>
        <dd>modern styles such as Twerking.</dd>
        <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
        <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have</dd>
        <dd>discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants</dd>
        <dd>of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this</dd>
        <dd>because they were really cold.</dd><br>
